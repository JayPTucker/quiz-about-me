## üìÑ Description: <a name='description'></a> 
**Updated (3/3/20):**

This Project/Website is simply a Quiz consisting of 5 Questions about myself made to test peoples knowledge about me!  Also, it was just something to help devlop my Skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, in which I did learn a lot while creating it.  The Quiz is timed and Scored and you're able to save your Score and look at it anytime even after a Page Refresh thanks to the use of Local Storage.

This Website will most likely not recieve any Updates in the future unless it is a dire bug that is discovered.
