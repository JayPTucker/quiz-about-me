## Description:
UPDATED (3/3/2020):
This Project/Website is simply a Quiz consisting of 5 Questions about myself made to test peoples knowledge about me!  Also, it was just something to help devlop my Skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, in which I did learn a lot while creating it.  The Quiz is timed and Scored and you're able to save your Score and look at it anytime even after a Page Refresh thanks to the use of Local Storage.

This Website will most likely not recieve any Updates in the future unless it is a dire bug that is discovered.

## Installation:
1. Clone the file from [my GitHub](https://github.com/JayPTucker)
2. Put it somewhere you'll remember (Best Choice for Easy Access: In a Folder on your Desktop)
3. Open GitBash and cd directly into the directory.
- "cd desktop" > "cd quiz-about-me" > Done!
4. Once you're CD'd inside of the Repository, type "code ." into GitBash and hit Enter.
5. VSCode should open (Or any other Software you use to code).
6. From there, you have all your files you need to begin coding.
7. Have fun! Send me what you did!

## Usage:
With this Website you're able to take a Timed Quiz about Myself.  Once you Start the Quiz your timer will start, you have 60 seconds to answer all 5 questions.  You get a Question right, you gain 10 Seconds and 10 Points.  However, if you get a Question wrong you will lose 20 Seconds and 5 Points.  Once you finish the Quiz it will Prompt you asking for your name, once you type in your name and Submit it, you'll be taken to the leaderboard section where you can view your Score at anytime, even after a page refresh.
